## Asymmetric Crypto with OPENSSL

1. Implement the RSA key generation with OpenSSL Big Numbers                                                                               
2. Implement the Diffie-Hellman parameters' generation  and key exchange with OpenSSL Big Numbers                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Generate a symmetric key and use OpenSSL RSA functions exchange it                                                         
4. Implement the enveloped data protocol (generate a symmetric key, encrypt a file, then exchange the generate key with RSA
